        # - .info - An array of the information of that unit from Juju
        # - .file(PATH) - Get the details of a file on that unit
        # - .file_contents(PATH) - Get plain text output of PATH file from that unit
        # - .directory(PATH) - Get details of directory
        # - .directory_contents(PATH) - List files and folders in PATH on that unit
        # - .relation(relation, service:rel) - Get relation data from return service
